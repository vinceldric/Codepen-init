#### Short Summary
<dd>I've found this cool <strong>Super Mario Random Quote Generator</strong> by <em>Joao Mateus</em> on Codepen and it generates some random quotes or expressions from the game Super Mario. It uses JavaScript but not using the `init()` function, so I implemented the `init()` function and put it on an external JavaScript file and link it inside the head tag of the `index.html`. I also did some tweaks on his `h1`, `h2`, `img`, and `footer` so that it is placed on the center of the web page.</dd>
